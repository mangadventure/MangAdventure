# Security Policy

We take security very seriously <!-- unlike MangaDex --> and have automated
[dependency alerts][] and [code scanning][] to make sure the project is secure.
If you still somehow find a vulnerability, here's how you can report it.

[dependency alerts]: https://github.com/mangadventure/MangAdventure/security/dependabot
[code scanning]: https://github.com/mangadventure/MangAdventure/security/code-scanning

## Supported Versions

During the beta phase, we will only patch security vulnerabilities in the [latest][latest] beta release.

[latest]: https://github.com/mangadventure/MangAdventure/releases/latest

## Reporting a Vulnerability

* Do not create issues to report security vulnerabilities.
* Instead, please e-mail the security maintainer at [chronobserver@disroot.org](mailto:chronobserver@disroot.org).
* You may encrypt the e-mail if you want (PGP key: `0x8A2DEA1DBAEBCA9E`).
* Avoid including any confidential information in the e-mail.
* Provide your GitHub username (if available), so that we can invite you to collaborate on a [security advisory][advisories].
* Alternatively, you can report the vulnerability [here][report].
