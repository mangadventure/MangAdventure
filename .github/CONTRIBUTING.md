mangadventure collectstatic # collect static files
mangadventure createsuperuser # create administrator
export MANGADV_DEBUG=1 # enable debug mode
mangadventure runserver # start server
```

After starting the server, you can go to [http://localhost:8000/admin-panel/](http://localhost:8000/admin-panel/) and
log in with the administrator account you created earlier to add content to the site.

You can lint the code and run tests like so:

```

After creating a new python file, run this to update the docs:

```sh

```
